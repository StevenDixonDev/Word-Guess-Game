# Word Guess Game

:european_castle: This is a Monty Python themed hangman game. Guess the words before the knight reach your castle!

## Things I wanted to do

- [x] Use css animations to move knights across the screen
- [x] Use audio to make it a more immersive game

## Things I learned

- Using object oriented programming can make smaller projects harder
- Keeping track of screen resizing with javascript is difficult and cumbersome
